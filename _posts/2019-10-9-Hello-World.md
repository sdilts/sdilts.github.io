It's about time that I started writing about some of the projects I'm working on, and what I've learned while making them.
Maybe I'll even write about something I feel strongly about at any
particular moment, whether it is about how great projects like
[Carp](https:github.com/carp-lang/Carp) are,
or how Common Lisp's path manipulation functions have a terrible
interface but some pretty useful features. Hopefully someone will find
these musing interesting. With that in mind, an online blog seems like the the best way to go.
